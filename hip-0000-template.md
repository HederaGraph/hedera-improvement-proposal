PLANNING TO USE HEDERA ID TOKEN RESOURCES TO MAKE HEDERA THE CENTER OF ALL DLT

I have an idea about planning to use digital resources to plan to use the length of the number string in hedera ID token

Hope Devs will read and pay attention to this proposal, if this proposal is really useful, please help me post it on HIP

Initiative on how to exploit and use hedera token resources to make hedera the most decentralized data platform and the center of all decentralized data ecosystems
So what I want to propose here is to plan to issue ID tokens from the beginning, to understand this issue clearly, I will give specific guidance through the following practical areas and applicationsÖ

BY PROVIDING PROOF PROOF AND SPECIFIC CASE BELOW
WE WILL SEE THE POWER OF HEDERA TOKEN SHOWN IN NUMERICAL FORM TO EXPLOIT THAT IN A WEIGHTED WAY AND IMPROVE THE POWER OF HEDERA FOR THE USERS OF THE ATTRACTIVE NETWORK

AND THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE GOAL OF FORCING RESOURCES PLANNING ACCORDING TO THE LENGTH OF THE CHARACTER OF THE DIGITS IN THE STRUCTURE OF HEDERA TOKEN IDS
WILL HELP HEDERA COMING SOON TO THE CENTER OF NETWORKS

CURRENTLY, NFT ISSUES OR TOPIC MESSAGES... ARE ALL ASSIGNED DATA IN ORDER OF THE CURRENT TOKEN ID, THIS IS A WASTE OF DIGITAL RESOURCES, BECAUSE THERE ARE MILLIONS OF NFT PRODUCTS EVERY DAY, BILLIONS OF TOPIC IDS EVERY DAY AND MOST OF THE

- NFT creations are in the form of single-use items: movie tickets, mass-produced products, time-limited coupons....
In the future, there will be billions of NFTs created every day like that, and it can also be deleted immediately after that

Meanwhile, at the present time, such NFTs are being mined in the order of token IDs equivalent to the current wallet or token ID,
which is a waste of resources because after the expiration date or after the product is used
it will be permanently deleted
For that reason, assign numeric values ​​to these NFTs with a character count of 15 or more
and prioritize numeric strings with a character count of <15 characters for wallet accounts, user accounts or identity accounts
domain names, users, user accounts, securities accounts, ID cards, licenses...

REASONS TO CONSIDER MINING OF HEDERAR TOKEN ID RESOURCES + SPECIFICALLY, THE DIRECTION SHOULD BE SPECIFIED BY CHARACTER LENGTH FOR EACH TYPE
EXAMPLE FOR NFT OR TOPIC MESSENGER + WILL BE DEFAULTED TO TOKEN TYPE WITH LENGTH OF 15 CHARACTERS OR MORE, PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO PERSONAL WALLETS, IDENTITIES, USER ACCOUNTS WITH
TOKEN ID LONGER LONGER LESS THAN 15 CHARACTERS

1- ADVANTAGES OF HEDERA'S TOKEN FORMAT

- Tokens are displayed in digital form. This is a prominent advantage that no other platform has. It excels in the following points.

+ Financially.
Hedera tokens are like bank accounts and users can easily transfer money to each other by

providing each other with account numbers, which is very close to any real business platform

While other platforms and ecosystems have to transfer money to each other using wallet codes, the rules of wallet codes are not easy to remember

Moreover, later, hedera is the center of networks

users or business platforms, they are willing to transfer bitcoin to each other or transfer any tokens to each other

they are also willing to pay a very small fee to use hedera wallet codes, which will be very convenient and easy

instead of transferring money internally between networks with messy wallet codes and no rules to remember

+ In terms of identity management

- Digital identities such as national ID cards in each country, degrees, graduation certificates or most identification issues are numbered in order and require a long string of long and short characters

CONCLUSION IN CONCLUSION, I RECOMMEND HEDERA DEVELOPERS TO CONSIDER AND LISTEN TO THIS PROPOSAL
Recognize the power of the digital hedera token and harness it in a way that applies to real-world applications
